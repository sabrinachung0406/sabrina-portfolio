## Outline
One of the most powerful strong suits for Disney is nostalgia, and now Disney is nearly remaking every single hit they ever have in store since its first animation movie, Snow White and the seven Dwarves. Therefore, I want to dig into and find out which character is the most profitable and whether remaking the story would be a promise to success.

### Story Structure
The story arc:
1. indentify the dominance of Disney studio in the entertainment industry 
2. In Disney's box office 2019, remake movies make up a huge proportion of its share 
3. Analyze the past characters and its profitability, and see if past animated movies' success can result in a remake's success, and if so, which IPs could be make into a remake, which are not recommended? 
4. Provoke audience's interests in these topics and movies (call to action)

## Data Sources:
I collected a lot of data sets that can be combined and break up in useful fractions.
I would be mostly using the box offices/ gross/ inflated adjusted gross/ market share/ characters/ genre... as my main source of data.

Also, I will be generating my own data set by hand typing in the remake movie list and their box office figures sinec I couldn't find it anywhere online.

## Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand as my final presentation tool, I have already set up one.
In total I would have around 8 graphs and I would also add in stories and thoughts to make the whole story arc complete and make sense!
Moreover, I'll probably include a video line chart as we've been showed in class.
