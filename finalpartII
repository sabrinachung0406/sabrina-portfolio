## User Feedback
My target audience is basically anyone who is interested in the movie industry, or enjoy watching movies, but the major target group would be people between 20 and 30, who grew up with Disney animated films and keep on being influenced by Disney works throughout the years. Therefore, I interviewd four people between this age range, including both genders for user feedback.

I think it is very clear and easy to read, and the topic is interesting so the audience can engage easily.
- What do you think the purpose is?
To know the trend of Disney movies and know more about the proportion of its box office success.
- What did you find confusing?
The gross and inflation gross chart is a bit confusing, there are too many ups and downs in a short amount of time. if only show the general trend would be helpful.
- What would you change?
It would be better if the bubble chart can be shown in character symbols! (for instance, a glass slipper for Cinderella, a lion for lion king..., etc.)
- Did you know these info before reading the website?
No.
- What would you do after reading the website?
It actually makes me want to go watch a Disney remake movie!

I like your visuals! The colors are appealing and graphs are clear, nothing too confusing overall.
- What do you think the purpose is?
To show the audience that Disney remakes could be successful and the importance they may bring to the market. And also the analyss of the Disney animated movies that could have potential to be remaked, or live actioned.
- What did you find confusing?
Is the data worldwide? Or is it just in America? 
- What would you change?
I would add the gross and marketshare growth worldwide.
- Did you know these info before reading the website?
Not exactly, I know that Disney is successful but the market share proportion is way greater than I previously thought.
- What would you do after reading the website?
Sounds interesting! I want to go watch Disney remakes and actually thinking about subscribing to Disney plus.

# Similarity
Seems like everyone appreciate the charts and graph being easy to read, which I believe is the key point of a data visualization.

# Difference 

## Improvement Implement
Integrating both my user feedback and the assignment feedback last week, here are the revised points:
- Clarify the geographical range as "North America" in the beginning of the whole story.
- Intensify the call to action point: 
- Improve the bubble chart
