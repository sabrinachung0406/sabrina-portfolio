# Telling Stories with Data Final Project
# Sabrina Chung

## Outline
One of the most powerful strong suits for Disney is nostalgia, and now Disney is nearly remaking every single hit they ever have in store since its first animation movie, Snow White and the seven Dwarves. Therefore, I want to dig into and find out which character is the most profitable and whether remaking the story would be a promise to success.

### Story Structure
The story arc:
1. indentify the dominance of Disney studio in the entertainment industry 
2. In Disney's box office 2019, remake movies make up a huge proportion of its share 
3. Analyze the past characters and its profitability, and see if past animated movies' success can result in a remake's success, and if so, which IPs could be make into a remake, which are not recommended? 
4. Provoke audience's interests in these topics and movies (call to action)

#### Conclusions
- Future remake movie list and recommendations

## Data Sources:
I collected a lot of data sets that can be combined and break up in useful fractions.
I would be mostly using the box offices/ gross/ inflated adjusted gross/ market share/ characters/ genre... as my main source of data.

**Disney company stats**

**Disney remakes list**
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Disney_live-action_remakes_of_animated_films

Also, I will be generating my own data set by hand typing in the remake movie list and their box office figures sinec I couldn't find it anywhere online.

## Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand as my final presentation tool, I have already set up one.
In total I would have around 8 graphs and I would also add in stories and thoughts to make the whole story arc complete and make sense!
Moreover, I'll probably include a video line chart as we've been showed in class.

## User Feedback
My target audience is basically anyone who is interested in the movie industry, or enjoy watching movies, but the major target group would be people between 20 and 30, who grew up with Disney animated films and keep on being influenced by Disney works throughout the years. 
Therefore, I interviewd four people between this age range, including both genders for user feedback.
The interviews were conducted either in English or Mandarin, I walked though the website but not going too into the details because I want to know their reaction to and understanding of the material without me explaining every single detail.

**1. Student, 22, Heinz College**
- Overall Comments:
I think it is very clear and easy to read, and the topic is interesting so the audience can engage easily.
- What do you think the purpose is? :
To know the trend of Disney movies and know more about the proportion of its box office success.
- What did you find confusing? :
The gross and inflation gross chart is a bit confusing, there are too many ups and downs in a short amount of time. if only show the general trend would be helpful.
- What would you change? :
It would be better if the bubble chart can be shown in character symbols! (for instance, a glass slipper for Cinderella, a lion for lion king..., etc.)
- Did you know these info before reading the website? :
No.
- What would you do after reading the website? :
It actually makes me want to go watch a Disney remake movie!

**2. Student, 23, Heinz College**
- What do you think the purpose is? :
A deep dive into Disney’s current content production strategy. 
- What did you find confusing? :
Call to action isn't clear. I don't know what I’m supposed to do with this information.
Disney’s dominance on box office isn’t logically connected to the analysis of remake box office. 
- What would you change? :
There should be a single color theme. I’d choose blue because it's Disney. 
Get rid of the inflation adjusted box office. If you want to suggest that Disney’s box office is increasing. 
For Disney’s north American box office, I don’t really know what the percentage is for. 
The bubble chart and the bar chart essentially show the same information. It’s redundant. 
I think your target audience should be Disney executives, and the call to action would be identifying what kind of new movies to make. 
There should be a clear conclusion of which IPs to remake and which ones are not recommended. 
- Did you know these info before reading the website? :
Yes.
- What would you do after reading the website? :
Watch Disney movies!

**4. Student, 22, International**
- Overall Comments :
I like your visuals! The colors are appealing and graphs are clear, nothing too confusing overall.
- What do you think the purpose is? :
To show the audience that Disney remakes could be successful and the importance they may bring to the market. And also the analysis of the Disney animated movies that could have potential to be remaked, or live actioned.
- What did you find confusing? :
Is the data worldwide? Or is it just in America? 
- What would you change? :
I would add the gross and marketshare growth worldwide.
- Did you know these info before reading the website? :
Not exactly, I know that Disney is successful but the market share proportion is way greater than I previously thought.
- What would you do after reading the website? :
Sounds interesting! I want to go watch Disney remakes and actually thinking about subscribing to Disney plus.

# Similarity and Differences
Seems like everyone appreciate the charts and graph being easy to read, which I believe is the key point of a data visualization.


## Improvement Implement
Integrating both my user feedback and the assignment feedback last week, here are the revised points:
- Clarify the geographical range as "North America" in the beginning of the whole story.
- Change the target audience into Disney executives, this way the call to action could be more accurate and helpful.
- Intensify the call to action point: Decide which character or IP is profitable enough for a remake.
- Improve the inflation graph, line graph, and the bubble chart. (as shown in the revised wireframe)
- Add transition paragraph between different parts of the story to make the whole flow smoother and more logical.
- Change the main color theme into blue.
