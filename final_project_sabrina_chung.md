## User Feedback
My target audience is basically anyone who is interested in the movie industry, or enjoy watching movies, but the major target group would be people between 20 and 30, who grew up with Disney animated films and keep on being influenced by Disney works throughout the years. 
Therefore, I interviewd four people between this age range, including both genders for user feedback.
The interviews were conducted either in English or Mandarin, I walked though the website but not going too into the details because I want to know their reaction to and understanding of the material without me explaining every single detail.

**1. Student, 22, Heinz College**
- Overall Comments:
I think it is very clear and easy to read, and the topic is interesting so the audience can engage easily.
- What do you think the purpose is? :
To know the trend of Disney movies and know more about the proportion of its box office success.
- What did you find confusing? :
The gross and inflation gross chart is a bit confusing, there are too many ups and downs in a short amount of time. if only show the general trend would be helpful.
- What would you change? :
It would be better if the bubble chart can be shown in character symbols! (for instance, a glass slipper for Cinderella, a lion for lion king..., etc.)
- Did you know these info before reading the website? :
No.
- What would you do after reading the website? :
It actually makes me want to go watch a Disney remake movie!

**2. Student, 23, Heinz College**
- What do you think the purpose is? :
A deep dive into Disney’s current content production strategy. 
- What did you find confusing? :
Call to action isn't clear. I don't know what I’m supposed to do with this information.
Disney’s dominance on box office isn’t logically connected to the analysis of remake box office. 
- What would you change? :
There should be a single color theme. I’d choose blue because it's Disney. 
Get rid of the inflation adjusted box office. If you want to suggest that Disney’s box office is increasing. 
For Disney’s north American box office, I don’t really know what the percentage is for. 
The bubble chart and the bar chart essentially show the same information. It’s redundant. 
I think your target audience should be Disney executives, and the call to action would be identifying what kind of new movies to make. 
There should be a clear conclusion of which IPs to remake and which ones are not recommended. 
- Did you know these info before reading the website? :
Yes.
- What would you do after reading the website? :
Watch Disney movies!

**3. Student, 25, Robotics Institute**
- Overall Comment:
I love the colorful design! It feels fun and very Disney-like. And the topic is fun and easy to make people want to read more.
- What do you think the purpose is? :
The box office power of Disney remakes, and to put emphasis on the possibility and profitability of an IP remake.
- What did you find confusing? :
The "Disney box office 2019" chart is a bit confusing, I can not tell the difference between two different colors without being explained at. (After she saw the verbal description, she finally understood the meaning of the graph)
- What would you change? :
I would put more emphasis on the conclusion and findings because I am a bit lost after reading though all those graphs.
- Did you know these info before reading the website? :
No.
- What would you do after reading the website? :
I realized that I haven't watch the most popular live action Disney movie (The lion King) yet, so it actually makes me want to go watch it now.

**4. Student, 22, International**
- Overall Comments :
I like your visuals! The colors are appealing and graphs are clear, nothing too confusing overall.
- What do you think the purpose is? :
To show the audience that Disney remakes could be successful and the importance they may bring to the market. And also the analysis of the Disney animated movies that could have potential to be remaked, or live actioned.
- What did you find confusing? :
Is the data worldwide? Or is it just in America? 
- What would you change? :
I would add the gross and marketshare growth worldwide.
- Did you know these info before reading the website? :
Not exactly, I know that Disney is successful but the market share proportion is way greater than I previously thought.
- What would you do after reading the website? :
Sounds interesting! I want to go watch Disney remakes and actually thinking about subscribing to Disney plus.

# Similarity and Differences
Seems like everyone appreciate the charts and graph being easy to read, which I believe is the key point of a data visualization. And also two of them seems to feel that the call to action is not clear enough and should be intensified. And also, the label for the graphs should be phrased more carefully and clearer.
One of the differences is that some people enjoy the colorful design, but one person suggested to unify the color scheme as blue, which is the color of Disney. (Which I adapted into my revised version because too many color might distract the audience from focusing on true important information)


## Improvement Implement
Integrating both my user feedback and the assignment feedback last week, here are the revised points:
- Clarify the geographical range as "North America" in the beginning of the whole story.
- Change the target audience into Disney executives, this way the call to action could be more accurate and helpful.
- Intensify the call to action point: Decide which character or IP is profitable enough for a remake.
- Improve the inflation graph, line graph, and the bubble chart. (as shown in the revised wireframe)
- Clearify the graph labels, rephrase with exrtra thought.
- Add transition paragraph between different parts of the story to make the whole flow smoother and more logical.
- Change the main color theme into blue.
