I chose this as my Data Visualization example because I am a huge Disney fan and I would be very interested in what kind of Disney movies sell the best in terms of genres. Also, this is a easy topic to approach and is a popular thing that most of the people would at least have a slight interest in. And for my final project I would like to do something Disney or entertainment related, so this is why I chose this particular data visualization.

*Revised Data Visualization for Disney Movies Gross*

- First Attempt Revise:
First of all, I added title "Disney Movies Gross 1937-2016" to my data visualization graph, this way the audience could clearly know what the data is about without going through all the texts. Secondly, I edited the rainbow color scheme into a 4 colored bar chart, and categorized different genre according to similar characteristics, for instance, I put "Adventure" and "Action" in the same yellow category, because they are movies that make people feel exciting. Third, I adjusted the scale of the y axix, the y axix of the original data visualization confused me very much because I can't even tell whether the numbers should be directly align with the supporting lines or should they be between, therefore, I changed the scale into 4 billion for each supporting line, which hopefully can be more precise and clear for the audience.
And I also draft the visualization in a circle chart. Though it is visually appealing and cute, but is a bit confusing and not very straightfoward to the point, which is an uneccesary design that could be adjusted.

- User Feedback:
All three of the people I showed my chart to said that the information is clear and easily understandable, the way the chart present the data is in tune with human intuition, and they could grasp the idea and the main point very directly, furthermore, they found the data interesting! One of them said it is very surprising to see adventure is the most profitable genre. (I thought it would be action too) But two of them didn't realize the what the color difference in the bars mean before I explained to them, and one of them suggest me to sort the genres in the right box in same category order, such as:

(But I don't know how to do that in Tableau! I tried to sort it manually but it kept changing the order of my chart simutaneously...)

- Final Revise:
I tried to sort the same colored genre together but I can't seem to do it in Tableau, but I changed the y axix scale as in 5 billion per line. I used 4 billion in the first version but I decided that 5 makes more sense because people are more likely to react to 5 better. And one more thing I would like to change but still can't figure out how is that instead of adding "B"s in y axix labels, I would use "Inflated Adjusted Gross (in billion)" instead.
