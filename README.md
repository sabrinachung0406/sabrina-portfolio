This is my public portfolio for TELLING STORIES WITH DATA class!

# About Me
Hello! My name is Sabrina, and I am a first year MEIM student in CMU Heinz College. 
I'm from Taiwan and my favorite thing about my home is the food so I tried hard to make similar dishes here in Pittsburgh (but seemingly failed).
My hidden superpower is that I know every single boring details about Disney Princesses and I seldom get an answer wrong in Disney Buzzfeed quizzes!

# What I hope to learn
I have always been looking foward to taking this class. I hope I can learn to be more precise and straight forward in my data presentation, I am good at drawing but sometimes I sacrifice clearness in order to be visual appealing, therefore, I hope to learn how to find the balance between. I like to create graphs so I am very excited to sharpen my skills by learning useful tools and even build a portfolio!

# Portfolio
This is where my works will be and I am very excited to see what my portfolio would be at the end of the course!
